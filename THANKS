What's this file about?
-----------------------
This file lists external open source projects that were the starting point of learning how to
write a GStreamer based media player.

1) GStreamer itself, gstreamer plugins base.
2) Totem, The gnome media player.
3) Aldegonde, the code is very clear and minimal, ideal to read before starting.

Thanks to all the people that contributed/ing to these projects, without, Parole wouldn't be possible.
